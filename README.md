# Welcome to Wordle game!

Wordle is a word-guessing game where you have 6 tries to guess a secret 5-letter word and getting a feedback!
If the letter is correct, it shows the **green** colour. But if its place is wrong, it shows the **yellow** colour. And finally if the letter doesn’t exist in the secret word, it shows the **grey** colour.
**Note** that the secret word is from a dataset and if your guess doesn’t belong to it you will loose 5 points.
Finally, if you guess the word from the first attempt you earn 10 points and if not your score will be 5 - the number of attempts.
